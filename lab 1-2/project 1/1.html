      <h2>The Best Way To Read Tolkien's Stories</h2>

      <h4>Basics: The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings</h4>
      <p class="textic">
        First, read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Keep in mind that
        The Hobbit was definitely written for children, and The Lord of the
        Rings was not. Also, read the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings,
        especially Appendices A and B.
      </p>
      <h4>
        The Legendarium:
        <p>The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, The History of Middle-earth</p>
      </h4>
      <div class="textic">
        <p>
          After you've read the basics, you have a choice: You can read The
          Children of Húrin or go straight to The Silmarillion.
        </p>
        <p>
          To some extent which you read first depends on how you reacted to the
          Appendices — if your reaction was, "This is so cool! Where can I get
          more of this!", jump straight into The Silmarillion; otherwise read
          The Children of Húrin, which will give you a somewhat easier
          introduction to the style and substance of Tolkien's other works.</p>
        <p>Overall they are much darker and denser than the better-known novels.
          If you enjoy The Children of Húrin, by all means read The
          Silmarillion. Don't be afraid to skip around in it or take notes.
          These should be followed by Unfinished Tales. I also recommend reading
          Tolkien's Letters at this point. </p>
        <p>
          oth the Letters and the Tales show Tolkien's mind at work as well as
          providing more details about his world. If you like that sort of thing
          and want more, there is the 12-volume (yes, twelve) History of
          Middle-earth series, which is a blow-by-blow presentation of the
          manuscripts Tolkien wrote for his legendarium, including the history
          of the writing of The Lord of the Rings. </p>
        <p id="the_end">
          Some of us think this is the
          greatest thing ever, being able to peer over the shoulder of the
          Creator at work, while for others it is far too reminiscent of college
          English classes.
