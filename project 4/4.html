                Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like
                IntelliSense code completion and debugging.First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your
                way. The delightfully frictionless
                edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your
                ideas</p>

            <p>
                Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is
                available for Windows, macOS and Linux. </p>

            <p>
                It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and
                Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python,
                PHP,
                Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity). </p>
            <p>
                Visual Studio Code was announced on April 29, 2015, by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference. A
                Preview build was released shortly thereafter. On November 18, 2015, Visual Studio Code was released
                under the Expat License and its source code posted to GitHub. Extension support was also announced.
                On April 14, 2016, Visual Studio Code graduated the public preview stage and was released to web.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 2016 Developers Survey of Stack Overflow, Visual Studio Code ranked #13 among the top popular
                development tools, with only 7.2% of the 46,613 respondents using it.[28] Two years later, however,
                Visual Studio Code achieved the #1 spot, with 34.9% of the 75,398 respondents using it.[29] In the
                latest survey, the 2019 Developers Survey, Visual Studio Code is still ranked #1, with 50.7% of the
                87,317 respondents using it.

            </header>
            <h6>Python extension</h6>
            <p>A Visual Studio Code extension with rich support for the Python language (for all actively supported
                versions of the language: 2.7, >=3.6), including features such as IntelliSense, linting, debugging,
                code navigation, code formatting, Jupyter notebook support, refactoring, variable explorer, test
                explorer, snippets, and more!
            </p>
            <h6>ESLint extension</h6>
            <The>Integrates ESLint into VS Code. If you are new to ESLint check the documentation. The extension uses
                the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder
                doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven't installed
                ESLint either locally or globally do so by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder for a
                local install or npm install -g eslint for a global install.
                </p>
                <h6> Prettier Formatter</h6>
                <p>Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and
                    re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when
                    necessary.
